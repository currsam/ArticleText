To update articles on the website this is what you need to do.
First click on articletext.txt
Once you have done that click on the little pen icon above the text.
Then you need to write in this specific format


Date | Headline | Link , Date | Headline | Link

All of the spaces that I put are IMPORTANT put a space before and after every vertical bar and comma.
Make sure the links include https://
Also you can put as many different articles as you want just make sure they are seperated by a comma.
